CssOrganizer
============

You see when you have those unwieldly .css files? Those that have grown over a year with last minute fixes appended at the end of the file with the false thought that "I'll organize everything this weekend". Well, I got a few of those myself so I need to come up with a way to automate most of the things I want to do to start with the reorganization. My first goals are:

- Group the blocks by selector.
- Sort the groups by the selector's name.

In the future ... when all is well (quoting Morrissey)

- Output a different file for each group of blocks.

If you come by this repo and can give me a hand with reducing the WTF/line ratio, I'll build a shrine in your honor and light a candle every new year's eve on your name.
